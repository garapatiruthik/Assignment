    "- Recall (also known as sensitivity) measures the ability of the model to correctly identify all positive instances of cancer, which in this context means correctly identifying all patients who actually have cancer.\n",
    "- A high recall ensures that the model detects the maximum number of cancer cases, minimizing false negatives (cases where cancer is present but not detected).\n",
