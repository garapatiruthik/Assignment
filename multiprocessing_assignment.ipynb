      "1. Execution Model:\n",
      "   - Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes simultaneously, each with its own memory space and resources.\n",
      "   - Multithreading involves running multiple threads within the same process, sharing the same memory space but executing concurrently.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Parallelism vs Concurrency:\n",
      "   - Multiprocessing enables true parallelism by utilizing multiple CPU cores, allowing tasks to run simultaneously.\n",
      "   - Multithreading achieves concurrency by interleaving the execution of multiple threads within the same process, but only one thread executes at a time due to Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Resource Isolation:\n",
      "   - Multiprocessing provides strong isolation between processes, ensuring that each process has its own memory space and resources.\n",
      "   - Multithreading shares the same memory space within a process, which can lead to potential data corruption and race conditions if not properly synchronized.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Communication and Synchronization:\n",
      "   - Multiprocessing uses inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms such as pipes, queues, and shared memory for communication between processes.\n",
      "   - Multithreading uses thread synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, and condition variables for coordinating access to shared resources.\n"
