A cursor can store data from a table or identify rows to be modified or deleted. You can create explicit cursors by declaring them and opening them, or implicit cursors by executing a SQL statement. An execute method is a way to run a SQL command using a cursor object. You can pass parameters to the execute method to bind variables in the SQL command.
