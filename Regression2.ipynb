    "- Advantages: Handles multicollinearity by shrinking coefficients. Works well when all predictors are potentially useful.\n",
    "- Trade-offs: Does not perform feature selection, potentially keeping irrelevant predictors.\n",

    "Model B (Lasso Regularization with alpha = 0.5):\n",
    "- Advantages: Performs shrinkage and feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero. Leads to a more interpretable model by removing irrelevant predictors.\n",
    "- Trade-offs: Sensitive to alpha choice. May underfit if alpha is too high. Selects only one variable from highly correlated ones.\n",

    "Choosing the Better Model:\n",
    "- If interpretability and fewer predictors are vital, Model B (Lasso) is preferred.\n",
    "- For managing multicollinearity and retaining all predictors, Model A (Ridge) might be better.\n",

    "Limitations:\n",
    "- Crucial to tune alpha for optimal performance.\n",
    "- Assumes linear predictor-outcome relationships.\n",
    "- Requires feature scaling for effective regularization.\"\"\")"
