      "Ans.In object-oriented programming (OOP) with Python, a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It serves as a blueprint for creating objects of a specific type. A class encapsulates data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.\n",

The primary purpose of the __init__() method is to initialize the attributes or properties of an object.An example for __init__() function is below to initialize the bio details as below:\n",

It acts as a reference to the current object being manipulated or accessed.When defining methods within a class, including the __init__() constructor, the first parameter is always self.
