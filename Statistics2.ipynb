      "Ans.Outliers can significantly impact measures of central tendency and dispersion:1. Central Tendency: - Outliers can skew the mean towards their direction, pulling it away from the bulk of the data.- The median is less affected by outliers since it is less influenced by extreme values.- The mode may not be affected at all by outliers, depending on their frequency and distribution.2. Dispersion:- Outliers can inflate measures of dispersion like the range, variance, and standard deviation.- The range, for instance, can be greatly affected by outliers, as they can pull the maximum or minimum values far from the rest of the data.- Variance and standard deviation are both sensitive to outliers because they are based on deviations from the mean.Example given below with a list containing outliers\n"
