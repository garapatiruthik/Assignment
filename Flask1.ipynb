      "Ans.**Flask** is a **Python** web framework that is used to develop web applications. It is a **micro-framework** that is lightweight and has minimal dependencies on external libraries. Flask was created to be fast and easy to use, and it can scale up to complex applications. Flask provides the required code when building a web application, allowing developers to start up a server, handle requests, templates, and much more. Flask is considered the best framework for light web application serving.\n",

      "- **Easy to understand development**: Flask is easy to understand, which makes it ideal for beginners. Its simplicity allows developers to navigate around and create the application easily. Unlike other web application frameworks, Flask lets you be in total control of web development, taking full creative control of the application. Flask's simplicity and minimalism mean that almost all parts of Flask are open to change, unlike some other web frameworks\n",
      "- **Flexible**: Flask is a flexible framework that allows you to customize and extend the framework to suit your needs easily. There are only a handful of parts of Flask that cannot be changed or altered because of its simplicity and minimalism³.\n",
      "- **Lightweight**: Flask is a lightweight backend framework with minimal dependencies. This makes it easy for beginners to learn and use.\n",
      "- **Built-in development server**: Flask provides a built-in development server that allows developers to test their applications quickly and easily.\n",
      "- **Fast debugger**: Flask has a fast debugger that helps developers debug their applications quickly.\n",
      "- **RESTful request dispatching**: Flask supports RESTful request dispatching, which makes it easy for developers to build RESTful APIs.\n",
