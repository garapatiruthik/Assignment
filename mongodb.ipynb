Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\\n\\nAns.The sort() method in MongoDB is used to sort the results of a query in ascending or descending order based on one or more fields. It allows you to specify the sorting criteria and the order (ascending or descending) for the documents in the result set.\\n\\nHere's a simple example to demonstrate how to use the sort() method in MongoDB:\\n\\nSuppose you have a collection with documents like this:\")"
